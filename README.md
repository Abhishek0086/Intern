# My Django Website Project

## Project Overview
This repository contains a website built using Django. The project is structured to separate the backend development from the frontend presentation.

## Repository Structure
- `main` branch: Contains the frontend of the website, ready for presentation.
- `django` branch: Houses the Django project with all backend code and functionalities.

## Branches
### Main Branch
The `main` branch is dedicated to showcasing the frontend of our website. This branch is what we use to demonstrate the look and feel of our site to the department.

### Django Branch
The `django` branch contains all the Django-related code, including:
- Django project setup
- Apps
- Models
- Views
- Templates
- URL configurations
- Static files
- Any backend-specific configurations

## Development Workflow
1. Backend development is done on the `django-backend` branch.
2. Frontend changes are made on the `main` branch.
3. When backend features are ready and tested, they are merged into the `main` branch.

## Viewing the Project
- To see the presentational frontend, check out the `main` branch.
- For full project functionality and backend code, switch to the `django` branch.
